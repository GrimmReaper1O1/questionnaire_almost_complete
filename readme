To those stupid enough to not want something that took two years for one person to create.
To those who are too stupid to not understand that this type of website otherwise costs them at least three million dollars to have made for them.
To those who are too stupid to know that this website didn't have a means of contact between people.
To those who are too stupid to know that there is no means of hacking into this website.
To those who are too stupid to know that this website didn't collect personal information.
To those who are too stupid to know that this website was a means of enriching your childrens and adults future alike by giving them a chance to catch up.
To those who are too stupid to know that this website gave a means of free education.
FUCK YOU!
I can't retract previous license agreements, but I'm sure as hell not going to finnish a free product for people which would come to my house with pitch forks
